# Charts Constellation: Effective Chart Summarization for Collaborative and Multi-User Analyses
This system is part Data Visualization course (CSE-578). It is based on this [paper](https://jeffjianzhao.bitbucket.io/papers/constellations.pdf) ,[ video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ltqB_hQc2A) .<br/>
Following technologies have been used `Java`, `Springboot`, `Angular.js`, `D3`, `Bubbleset.js`, `Maven`.
Database: `MongoDB`. <br/>
The system helps a single person study a complex dataset quickly and efficiently. The application derives all the information for a specific dataset at the backend and helps the user to study it by showing them, charts and user stories, `already` created by other users. Hence, it saves a lot of time for a new user, who is just starting to perform analytics on a dataset. The system is also capable of suggesting those attributes of the dataset, which have not been explored in detail yet. Hence, the user can create new charts and user stories using `Charts-Constellation` itself.


## Steps to run the application:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure that you have java version >= 1.8.
3. Run Maven Clean and Maven install.
4. Go to App.java and run it as java application.
5. Check the console if the app has started running. If yes, go to 127.0.0.1:8080.
